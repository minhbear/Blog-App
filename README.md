# Blog-App

This app I build in backend and frontend

In backend I use MongooDB is Database i save all information of blog that user create, because the information save in databse is just a blog so I not need to use sql to create and do CRUD action in that, mongooDB is best way in here. 

The next one to create and build api I use node js is enviroment to code logic backend and use express js to create api, this api I will use to connect all action of user in frontend.

In frontend I use React js is library to build the site of client to interact, with use content and reducer hook i can interact to child component with the esay logic and use react-router-dom to create the each site of component for user

Install dependency project: npm i || npm install
